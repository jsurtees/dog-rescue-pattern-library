This gorgeous boy is approximately 2- 3 years old and loves to play, especially tug! He also loves bones and chew toys. We believe he may be a Pakistani Bull Terrier, or perhaps a Bull Terrier mix. </p>

            <p class="card-body-txt gutter-half micro pad-b">​Luna is a 1 year old shepherd who's had a bit of a rough start in life. But true to a dog's outlook, she's never looked back. Due to the lack of structure when she was young, she's best thought of as a young puppy in an adult body, and full of energy to boot!</p>

She will be up for adoption after she has weaned her kittens and after she is spay. She is such a gentle soul.</p>

She is finally healthy enough to be brought UTD on vaccines and will be spay at the end of Feb. We will update her bio after she is spay</p>

            <p class="card-body-txt gutter-half micro pad-b micro">Ella is a diamond in the rough. She came from less than stellar circumstances and is quite shy. Once she warms up she turns into to be a sweet and cuddle loving dog – but her adopter needs to be comfortable knowing that this may take some time.</p>
