The two main buttons of the site. One is a simple call to action and one is to be combined with a card.

- Regular buttons are for forms, donation buttons, and anything else. They use the orange accent color.
- Card buttons are only to be used with cards - nowhere else.
- Back and forward buttons are used while viewing a specifics dogs page. These move the user from dog to dog.
- The F button is a facebook link.

The primary button could vary in size, but not the card button.
