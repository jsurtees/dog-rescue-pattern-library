The two main buttons of the site. One is a simple call to action and one is to be combined with a card.

- Regular buttons are for forms, donation buttons, and anything else. They use the orange accent color.
- Card buttons are only to be used with cards - nowhere else.

The primary button could vary in size, but not the card button.
