fonts:
  primary: |
    The primary typeface, *Amatica*, is a fun, yet clean display typeface used for headers. The target demographic often prefers a sappy or extravagant style. This is shown in countless posters I have seen in the community.

    Use the primary typeface for headers, forms and some accents to typography.
  secondary: |
    The seocndary typeface, *Dosis*, is a rounded sans serif. It contrasts the bright display typeface well. It matches the clean style and colors of the site.

    Use the secondary typeface for regular body copy.
colors:
  primary: |
    The primary color is a dark, calming grey. It is used as the background color of the site.
  accent: |
     Light orange promotes empathy, which will be important on a non-profit organization. The pink accent color is used to create a sense of love, loyalty and commitment.
